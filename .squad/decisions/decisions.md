# Squad Decisions

## Scripting Directive (2026-04-23T20:17:00Z)

**By:** Dave Grobleski  
**Status:** Active  

All implementation must be 100% scripted—no manual "log in and click around" portal steps. Scripts and source code wherever possible. Fabric steps should describe what's happening but use IaC/scripting, not point-and-click instructions.

**Applied To:**
- `docs/implementation-plan.md` rewrite (2026-04-23T20:27:00Z)
- All future phase deliverables

**Reference:** Compliance verification in orchestration-log/20260423T202700Z-danny.md

## Real AAP Schema Received and Documented (2025-07)

**Proposed by:** Data Engineer  
**Status:** Proposed  

The real AAP Loyalty Database schema has been received (via architecture diagram) and documented in `docs/aap-schema-reference.md`. Includes 8 core table groups, 6 source systems, and mapping to 7 existing semantic contract views.

**Key Findings:**
- **CrowdTwist** external loyalty engine significantly more complex than placeholder
- **Coupons** are major first-class domain requiring dedicated semantic view
- **Audit/Fraud** and **Agent/CSR tracking** are distinct data domains not in placeholder
- No explicit stores table (embedded in transaction records)

**Recommended Actions:**
- Two new views: `v_coupon_activity`, `v_audit_trail`
- Four existing views need remapping with column-level detail
- Placeholder schema remains active until production access granted

**Blocker:** Column-level schema detail (DDL or data dictionary) required from AAP to complete view remapping.

**References:**
- `docs/aap-schema-reference.md` — Full schema reference with mapping and gap analysis
- `docs/data-schema.md` — Placeholder schema (updated with cross-reference)

## Implementation Plan v3 — Strategy-Focused Format (2026-04-25)

**Owner:** Lead Architect  
**Status:** Implemented  

Rewrote `docs/implementation-plan.md` as a strategy-focused technical design document (406 lines) rather than a scripted runbook. Scripts are referenced by filename with 1-line descriptions but source code is not inlined.

**Rationale:**
- v2 (1,258 lines) contained full bash/PowerShell/curl blocks making doc unwieldy
- Customer-facing docs communicate architecture and approach, not copy-paste runbooks
- Script source code belongs in `scripts/` directory, not duplicated in planning
- Phase 4 (web app) doesn't need detailed implementation yet—architecture contract sufficient

**What Changed:**
- Full script blocks → script name + 1-line description + referenced filename
- Step-by-step CLI walkthroughs → automation approach narrative
- Phase 4 detailed React/TypeScript code → 1 paragraph + architecture diagram
- Added: Monitoring section, success criteria, prerequisites summary table
- Kept: Scripts inventory, risk register, timeline, validation criteria, schema swap procedure

**Impact:**
- `docs/implementation-plan.md`: 406 lines (down from 1,258)
- No changes to other docs or code
- Old versions preserved as `implementation-plan-scripted.md` (v2) and `implementation-plan-manual.md` (v1)

## Fabric Lakehouse Spark — No Schema Prefix (2025-07-15)

**Author:** Livingston (Data Engineer)  
**Status:** Implemented  

**Context:** The sample data notebook used `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS mirrored` and wrote all tables as `mirrored.tablename`. This fails in Fabric Lakehouse Spark with `java.lang.RuntimeException: Feature not supported on Apache Spark in Microsoft Fabric.`

**Decision:** All Delta tables in Fabric Lakehouse notebooks must be written to the **default Lakehouse database** without any schema prefix. Use `saveAsTable("tablename")`, never `saveAsTable("schema.tablename")`.

**Rationale:**
- Fabric Lakehouse Spark runtime does not support `CREATE SCHEMA` or custom schema namespaces
- The Contoso Fabric reference project confirms this pattern — tables are written directly
- The SQL Endpoint exposes tables under `dbo` schema automatically

**Impact:**
- **Notebook fixed**: All 13 `mirrored.` references removed from sample data notebook
- **Semantic views**: The `scripts/create-semantic-views.sql` already uses `dbo.tablename` via the SQL Endpoint — no change needed there
- **Team awareness**: Any future Fabric Spark notebooks must follow this pattern

---

## Rename agents/agent_activities → csr/csr_activities (2025-07-14)

**Author:** Livingston (Data Engineer)  
**Status:** Implemented  

**Context:** The word "agent" was overloaded in this project — it referred to both Fabric Data Agent (AI) personas and customer service representatives in the data schema. This caused confusion in code reviews and discussions.

**Decision:** Rename the CSR-related tables and columns throughout the data layer:
- Table `agents` → `csr`
- Table `agent_activities` → `csr_activities`
- Columns: `agent_id` → `csr_id`, `agent_name` → `csr_name`, `agent_email` → `csr_email`
- View column: `agent_department` → `csr_department`

**Impact:**
- **Notebook** (`notebooks/01-create-sample-data.py`): All variables, schemas, and saveAsTable calls updated
- **Semantic views** (`scripts/create-semantic-views.sql`): `v_audit_trail` now references `dbo.csr` and `dbo.csr_activities`
- **Sample queries** (`config/sample-queries.json`): Updated column names in audit trail query
- **No impact** on Fabric Data Agent persona configs (`agents/` folder) — those use "agent" in the AI persona sense, not the data table sense

**Team Action:** If anyone has local Fabric deployments with the old `agents`/`agent_activities` tables, they need to re-run the notebook and re-deploy semantic views. The semantic model TMDL (if started) needs to reflect the new table/column names.

---

## CSR Rename — User Directive (2026-04-24T15:49:24Z)

**By:** Dave Grobleski (via Copilot)  
**Status:** Directive  

Rename `agents` table to `csr` and `agent_activities` table to `csr_activities`. The word "agent" is too overloaded (AI agents vs customer service agents). CSR (Customer Service Representative) is the industry standard abbreviation.

---

## Fabric Data Agent Group Design (2026-07)

**Owner:** Danny (Lead/Architect)  
**Status:** Implemented  

Designed and created a group of 5 Fabric Data Agents for the AAP Rewards & Loyalty workspace, each with distinct business persona, scoped view access, cross-agent referrals, and consistent guardrails.

**Rationale:**
- **5 agents (not 4):** Customer Service warranted separation from Loyalty Program Manager because the audit trail serves a fundamentally different audience (service ops managers vs. loyalty program strategists). Combining them would create a confused persona.
- **All 9 semantic views assigned:** Every view has a primary agent owner. No orphaned views. Secondary access granted where cross-domain queries are natural.
- **Cross-agent referral network:** Every agent can redirect out-of-scope questions. This prevents dead-end conversations and teaches users the agent ecosystem.
- **Consistent guardrail framework:** All 5 agents share the same guardrail categories (no PII in aggregates, no fabrication, no predictions, scope boundaries, data freshness). This makes the system predictable and auditable.
- **33 total example Q&A pairs:** Calibrated to realistic auto parts loyalty numbers matching our sample data scale.

**Impact:**
- All agents reference the shared `RewardsLoyaltyData` semantic model
- Agent configs are ready for Fabric Data Agent deployment in Phase 3
- Examples serve as test fixtures for Data Agent accuracy validation
- Cross-agent referrals will need runtime routing when deployed (not yet implemented)

**Files:** `agents/` directory with 5 subfolders, 3 files each (15 files) + `agents/BUILD_SUMMARY.txt`

## Notebook Deployment via Fabric REST API (2026-04-26)

**Author:** Basher (Backend Dev)  
**Status:** Implemented  

**Context:** Needed automated way to upload and run notebooks in Fabric workspace without manual portal interaction.

**Decision:** Use Fabric's `fabricGitSource` notebook format (not ipynb) with the Items/Notebooks REST API. Lakehouse attachment is embedded directly in the notebook metadata header, not via a separate API call.

**Key Details:**
- Script: `scripts/run-notebook.py`
- Format conversion: Jupytext `# %%` → Fabric `# CELL` / `# MARKDOWN` / `# METADATA`
- Auth: `InteractiveBrowserCredential` (browser popup), consistent with `provision-lakehouse.py`
- Idempotent: checks for existing notebook, updates definition if found
- Features: `--dry-run` (preview conversion), `--skip-run` (upload only), `--auth device-code`

**Impact:**
- Enables automated notebook deployment as part of provisioning pipeline
- Notebook uploaded successfully (ID: `1121f044-f79e-45b2-adeb-dcd87ece6244`)
- Execution triggered but PySpark code failed — needs notebook content debugging in Fabric portal

## Script Review: setup-workspace.ps1 & deploy-semantic-views.ps1 (2026-04-25)

**Reviewer:** Basher (Backend Dev)  
**Status:** Reviewed & Fixed  

**Context:** Pre-deployment review — workspace already manually created (ID: 82f53636-206f-4825-821b-bdaa8e089893) due to Microsoft tenant API issues.

**Critical Issues Found & Fixed:**

### Bug 1: Schema-Qualified View Names Not Captured
- **Location:** `deploy-semantic-views.ps1` lines 93-98  
- **Issue:** Regex patterns only match `[?dbo]?.\w+` but actual SQL uses `semantic.viewname`
- **Fix:** Updated regex to match schema-qualified names
- **Impact:** All views would be logged as "unknown" instead of their actual names

### Bug 2: Comments in .env.fabric Break Parser
- **Location:** `deploy-semantic-views.ps1` line 56  
- **Issue:** Regex will capture comments as part of the value
- **Fix:** Updated regex to stop capture at `#` character
- **Impact:** SQL connection would fail with "Invalid server name"

### Issue 3: System.Data.SqlClient Deprecated
- **Location:** `deploy-semantic-views.ps1` line 209  
- **Mitigation:** Script correctly tries `Invoke-Sqlcmd` first. README documents SqlServer module installation.
- **Recommendation:** Update README to strongly recommend `Install-Module SqlServer` before running

### Issue 4: Token Expiry in Long-Running Batches
- **Location:** `deploy-semantic-views.ps1` lines 190-233  
- **Reality check:** 9 views won't take 60 minutes; not a practical concern

**Verified Correct:**
- ✅ Workspace existence check and skip logic
- ✅ Lakehouse existence check and idempotent behavior
- ✅ 409 conflict recovery for both workspace and lakehouse
- ✅ SQL endpoint pending state handling
- ✅ .env.fabric output format matches consumer expectations
- ✅ OData filter encoding

**Deployment Readiness:** ✅ Ready to deploy after fixes applied

## Pre-Deployment Code Review: Livingston (2026-04-26)

**Reviewer:** Livingston (Data Engineer)  
**Scope:** Pre-deployment code review of notebooks/01-create-sample-data.py, scripts/create-semantic-views.sql, config/sample-queries.json

**Summary:** Reviewed all deployment artifacts before deploying to Fabric workspace 82f53636-206f-4825-821b-bdaa8e089893. Found and fixed 4 critical T-SQL syntax bugs that would have caused deployment failure.

**Critical Bugs Fixed:**

1. **CREATE SCHEMA Syntax** — `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS semantic;` not valid T-SQL. Replaced with T-SQL-compatible pattern using `IF NOT EXISTS` wrapper
2. **Boolean Literals** — Used `false`/`true` in CASE statements; T-SQL requires `0`/`1`
3. **Correlated Subquery GROUP BY** — Missing `t.member_id` in GROUP BY caused aggregation error
4. **Duplicate Label in Verification Query** — 'v_transaction_history' appears twice; second should be 'v_points_activity'

**Verified Correct:**
- ✅ CREATE OR ALTER VIEW syntax
- ✅ Column references across all 9 views
- ✅ Sample queries (25 natural language → SQL pairs)
- ✅ Notebook (PySpark syntax, Delta schema)

**Recommendation:** **APPROVED FOR DEPLOYMENT** — All critical bugs fixed

## Pre-Deployment Integration Review: Rusty (2026-04-27)

**Reviewer:** Rusty (QA)  
**Target:** Fabric workspace 82f53636-206f-4825-821b-bdaa8e089893  
**Scope:** Cross-cutting integration review of all deployment artifacts

**Summary:** ✅ **DEPLOYMENT APPROVED** — All critical integration points validated. One cosmetic issue found in commented-out code (non-blocking).

**Integration Points Validated:**

| Category | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Notebook → Views schema | ✅ PASS | All table/column references correct |
| Views → Queries | ✅ PASS | All view/column references correct |
| Scripts → .env.fabric | ✅ PASS | File format and keys match |
| Deployment order | ✅ PASS | README instructions match dependencies |
| .gitignore | ✅ PASS | Secrets properly excluded |

**Issues Found:**
- 🟡 **ISSUE:** Copy/paste error in SQL verification comment (line 343) — typo "v_transaction_history" but queries "v_points_activity". Cosmetic only, non-blocking.

**Recommendations:**
1. Deploy as-is — All critical integration points validated
2. Optional fix: Correct typo in line 343 (cosmetic only)
3. Post-deployment verification: Run verification queries at end of create-semantic-views.sql

## Architecture Correction: Semantic Models, Not SQL Views (2026-04-24T16:36:13Z)

**By:** Dave Grobleski (via Copilot)  
**Status:** Directive — Architecture Pivot  

**The Problem:** 
The initial architecture used SQL views as the query abstraction layer. However, the Fabric Data Agent consumes Fabric semantic models (workspace-level Power BI dataset items), not SQL views. SQL views are database objects inside the SQL Analytics Endpoint—they do NOT surface as workspace-level items.

**The Correction:**
The correct architecture is:
```
Delta Tables (Lakehouse, dbo schema) → Semantic Model (workspace item) → Fabric Data Agent + Power BI
```

**Key Findings:**
- Livingston initially created `create-semantic-model.py` to create a semantic model from the SQL views as an optional layer
- On user directive, the Coordinator **rewrote** `create-semantic-model.py` to source directly from the 10 Delta tables (dbo schema), bypassing SQL views entirely
- The semantic model now defines:
  - 10 Delta table references (dbo.members, dbo.transactions, dbo.rewards_catalog, dbo.loyalty_program_tiers, dbo.member_engagement, dbo.csr, dbo.csr_activities, dbo.fraud_incidents, dbo.system_metadata, dbo.external_enrichment)
  - 7 relationships (many-to-one joins between tables)
  - 16 DAX measures (aggregates, KPIs, ratios)

**Implications:**
- SQL views (`deploy-views.py`, `create-semantic-views.sql`) are now **obsolete** for the Data Agent architecture
- The semantic model is the single source of truth for Data Agent queries
- SQL views may still be useful for Power BI report authoring (if needed for complex queries), but they are not required
- Power BI can also query the semantic model directly (recommended path)

**Obsolete Artifacts:**
- `scripts/deploy-views.py` — No longer needed; SQL endpoint is not the query abstraction
- `scripts/create-semantic-views.sql` — 9 views are not consumed by the architecture
- `scripts/verify-views.py` — No longer needed for validation

**Impact:**
- Fabric Data Agent deployment now depends on `create-semantic-model.py` for the query layer
- Removes unnecessary middleware; simplifies the data pipeline
- Aligns with Fabric best practices (semantic models are the primary Fabric query abstraction)

## Power BI Authoring Stop Directive (2026-04-24T16:36:13Z)

**By:** Dave Grobleski (via Copilot)  
**Status:** Directive — Halt Power BI Work  

**Directive:** 
Do not proceed with Power BI report authoring or dashboard creation at this time. The Data Agent is the primary UI for this POC. Once the Fabric Data Agent is operational and validated, Power BI reporting can be re-evaluated.

**Rationale:**
- Fabric Data Agent is the core deliverable for Phase 3
- Power BI is secondary; it should not block or delay Data Agent deployment
- Power BI report work will resume only after Data Agent validation is complete

**Impact:**
- Phase 3 deliverables focus exclusively on Fabric Data Agent
- Power BI specifications (`docs/power-bi-specifications.md`) are preserved but not active
- Power BI work is deferred to Phase 4 or post-POC

## Semantic Model Architecture Review (2026-04-24T17:08)

**Date:** 2026-04-24  
**Author:** Danny (Lead/Architect)  
**Requested by:** Dave Grobleski  
**Status:** Implemented

### Context

The "AAP Rewards Loyalty Model" was deployed with a 1:1 mapping of 10 Lakehouse Delta tables, 7 relationships, and 16 DAX measures. This was a rapid deployment without a formal architecture exercise. Five AI agent personas will query this model via Fabric Data Agent. A comprehensive review was conducted.

### Key Decisions

**D1: Single Shared Semantic Model (Confirmed)**
- Keep ONE semantic model shared by all 5 agent personas
- Rationale: Cross-domain queries require joins across tables; splitting per-agent would create 5× maintenance burden and inconsistent measure definitions
- Impact: No structural change needed

**D2: Add Missing Relationship — Coupons → Transactions**
- Add relationship from `coupons.redeemed_transaction_id` → `transactions.transaction_id`
- Rationale: Marketing agent cannot calculate revenue from coupon-driven purchases without this traversal
- Impact: One new relationship; low risk
- Owner: Data Engineer

**D3: Add ~20 Missing DAX Measures**
- Add approximately 20 DAX measures across all agent domains (see docs/semantic-model-architecture.md §1.4)
- Rationale: Current 16 measures cover basic counts/sums; agents need computed metrics like Return Rate, Churn Risk, Points Liability, Coupon Redemption Rate, Opt-In Rates, etc.
- Impact: Measure additions only; no breaking changes
- Owner: Data Engineer

**D4: Add Column Descriptions and Synonyms (Prep for AI)**
- Every table, column, and measure must have plain-English description and relevant synonyms
- Rationale: Fabric Data Agent accuracy depends entirely on metadata quality
- Impact: Metadata-only changes; no schema changes
- Owner: Data Engineer (descriptions), Lead Architect (AI instructions)

**D5: Write AI Instructions for Semantic Model**
- Add comprehensive natural language AI instructions covering business context, tier definitions, calculation rules, and domain vocabulary
- Rationale: AI cannot infer that "revenue" should exclude returns, or that points are valued at $0.01
- Impact: Prep for AI configuration in Fabric portal
- Owner: Lead Architect

**D6: Update Agent Configs to Reference Actual Table Names**
- Replace all `semantic.v_*` view references in agent config.json files with actual semantic model table names
- Rationale: Deployed semantic model contains raw Delta tables, not SQL views; agent configs referencing non-existent views cause Data Agent failures
- Impact: Config file changes only; all 5 agents affected
- Owner: Backend Dev (completed in this session)

**D7: Add Calculated Columns and Display Folders**
- Add calculated columns (Full Name, Days Since Last Purchase, Member Tenure, Year-Month) and organize measures into display folders by domain
- Rationale: Enables common agent queries without complex DAX; display folders make model navigable for AI and humans
- Impact: Model enhancement; additive only
- Owner: Data Engineer

**D8: Business Ontology Documented**
- Business ontology (concept hierarchy, entity relationships, domain glossary) documented in docs/semantic-model-architecture.md Part 3
- Rationale: Shared vocabulary ensures consistent terminology across agents, developers, and stakeholders
- Impact: Reference document; no code changes
- Owner: Lead Architect

### Deliverables

- **docs/semantic-model-architecture.md** (650 lines) — Model architecture, AI prep, ontology specifications
- **5 agent config.json files** — Updated with actual table references
- **5 agent instructions.md files** — AI guidance and domain context
- All decisions recorded and prioritized for implementation

### Priority Order

1. 🔴 **Critical:** D6 (fix agent configs), D4 (descriptions/synonyms), D5 (AI instructions), D2 (missing relationship), D3 (missing measures)
2. 🟡 **High:** D7 (calculated columns/folders), verified answers configuration
3. 🟢 **Medium:** Hierarchies, Date table, AI Data Schema configuration

- Agent configs: `agents/*/config.json`
- Deployed model: "AAP Rewards Loyalty Model" in Fabric workspace

## Phase 1 Semantic Model Enrichments (2026-04-24)

**Date:** 2026-04-24  
**Author:** Livingston (Data Engineer)  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Requested by:** Dave Grobleski  

### Context

Danny completed an architecture review of the "AAP Rewards Loyalty Model" semantic model (`docs/semantic-model-architecture.md`) and identified Phase 1 critical items needed for AI Data Agent readiness. The baseline model had:

- 10 tables (1:1 Delta table mapping) ✅
- 7 relationships
- 16 DAX measures
- Table descriptions but NO column descriptions
- NO synonyms or AI instructions
- NO display folders for measure organization
- Missing ~20 DAX measures the agents need for their domains
- Missing 1 relationship (coupons → transactions)

### Decision

Implemented ALL Phase 1 critical items in `scripts/create-semantic-model.py`:

#### 1. Added Missing Relationship
- **Added:** `coupons.redeemed_transaction_id → transactions.transaction_id`
- **Marked INACTIVE** to avoid ambiguous path (coupons → transactions → loyalty_members conflicts with direct coupons → loyalty_members)
- **Usage:** Marketing agent can use `USERELATIONSHIP()` in DAX measures to calculate revenue from coupon-driven purchases

#### 2. Added Column Descriptions
- **Extended all column tuples** from `(name, type, label)` to `(name, type, label, description)`
- **Every column now has a plain-English description** sourced from the architecture doc §2.2
- **TMDL implementation:** Column descriptions added as `annotation Description = "..."` because TMDL doesn't support native column-level `description` property
- **AI readability:** Descriptions use business language, not technical jargon (e.g., "Member's current available points balance (earned minus redeemed minus expired)")

#### 3. Added ~20 Missing DAX Measures
**Organized into 6 display folders for agent domains:**

**📊 Membership (7 measures):**
- New Members This Month
- Churn Risk Members (180+ days since last purchase)
- Email Opt-In Rate
- SMS Opt-In Rate
- Avg Lifetime Spend
- Points Liability ($)

**💰 Revenue & Transactions (8 measures):**
- Total Revenue (filters to purchase-only)
- Return Rate
- Avg Items Per Transaction
- Unique Members (Transacting)
- (existing: Purchase Count, Return Count, Avg Transaction Value, Total Transactions)

**🏪 Store Performance (2 measures):**
- Revenue Per Store
- Total Stores

**🎟️ Coupons & Campaigns (7 measures):**
- Coupons Expired
- Coupons Voided
- Outstanding Coupons
- Avg Discount Value
- (existing: Coupons Issued, Coupons Redeemed, Coupon Redemption Rate)

**⭐ Points & Rewards (5 measures):**
- Points Liability ($) = SUM(current_points_balance) × 0.01
- (existing: Total Points Balance, Avg Points Balance, Points Earned, Points Redeemed)

**🛡️ Service & Audit (4 measures):**
- Active CSR Agents
- Avg Activities Per CSR
- CSR Activities This Month
- Total CSR Interactions

**📦 Product Performance (1 measure):**
- Unique Products Sold

#### 4. Display Folders
- All measures organized into display folders using `displayFolder: "folder name"` TMDL property
- Emoji icons in folder names for visual navigation (UTF-8 handled correctly)
- Folders align with the 5 agent personas (Loyalty Program Manager, Store Operations, Marketing, Merchandising, Customer Service)

#### 5. TMDL Code Updates
- Updated `build_tmdl_definition()` to handle 4-element column tuples (name, type, label, description)
- Updated measure generation to handle 6-element tuples (table, name, DAX, format, description, display_folder)
- Updated relationship generation to support 5-element tuples (from_table, from_col, to_table, to_col, is_active)
- Added `isActive: false` TMDL property for inactive relationships

### Outcomes

✅ **Successfully deployed to Fabric workspace `82f53636-206f-4825-821b-bdaa8e089893`**

**Final metrics:**
- 10 tables (all columns described)
- 8 relationships (1 inactive)
- 34 DAX measures (up from 16)
- 6 display folders
- Ready for Phase 2 (synonyms, AI instructions, verified answers)

**Dry-run verified before deployment:**
```
Tables:       10 Delta tables
Relationships:8 (1 inactive)
DAX Measures: 34
Definition parts: 14
```

### TMDL Lessons Learned

#### What Works
✅ `annotation Description = "..."` on columns  
✅ `displayFolder: "folder name"` on measures  
✅ `isActive: false` on relationships  
✅ Emoji in display folder names (UTF-8 encoding)  
✅ Partition M expression with `source =` and indented let/in block

#### What Doesn't Work
❌ Table-level `description` property (parse error)  
❌ Table-level `lineageTag` property (parse error)  
❌ Column-level native `description` property (not supported)  
❌ Column-level `annotation PBI_DisplayName` (removed to be safe)

### Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. **Add synonyms** via Fabric portal "Prep for AI" UI (table, column, value synonyms from architecture doc §2.3)
2. **Write AI instructions** in Prep for AI pane (business context, tier definitions, calculation rules from §2.4)
3. **Configure verified answers** for top business questions (§2.5)
4. **Run 25 sample questions** and validate answers
5. **Iterate synonyms/descriptions** based on test results

### Team Impact

**Backend Dev:** Agent config files still reference SQL view names (`semantic.v_*`). These should be updated to reference actual semantic model tables or removed if agents query the semantic model directly via Fabric Data Agent.

**Danny (Lead/Architect):** Phase 1 complete per your architecture review. Ready for you to configure synonyms and AI instructions via Fabric portal UI (Phase 2 items 2-4 from the doc).

**All Agents:** The semantic model now has 34 measures organized by domain. You can reference these in your agent configurations and natural language queries.

## Linguistic Schema via Copilot Folder Structure (2026-04-24)

**Author:** Livingston (Data Engineer)  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Artifact:** `scripts/configure-linguistic-schema.py`

### Context

The enriched semantic model (34 DAX measures, 8 relationships, column descriptions) needed synonyms and AI instructions to be AI-ready. Dave specifically flagged CSR tables as a priority — users say "agents" and "reps" but the tables are named `csr` and `csr_activities`.

### Decision

Use the Fabric REST API `updateDefinition` endpoint to inject a `Copilot/` folder structure into the semantic model definition, containing:

1. **`Copilot/Instructions/instructions.md`** — 53-line AI business context block
2. **`Copilot/linguisticMetadata.json`** — Full Q&A linguistic schema with table, column, and value synonyms in LSDL JSON format
3. **`Copilot/settings.json`** — Enable Q&A and Copilot features
4. **`definition.pbism`** — Updated with `qnaEnabled: true`

### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Approach | Why Not |
|--------|----------|---------|
| A | Embed linguisticMetadata in TMDL `cultures/en-US.tmdl` | TMDL syntax for linguistic metadata on Culture objects is underdocumented; high risk of parse errors |
| B | Set synonyms via Power BI Desktop UI ("Prep for AI") | Manual process, not scriptable, doesn't fit our CI/CD pipeline |
| C | Use annotations on table/column TMDL files | Annotations are for descriptions, not linguistic metadata; synonyms need the LSDL format |

### Chosen: Copilot/ folder in REST API definition

**Rationale:**
- The Fabric REST API definition spec explicitly documents the `Copilot/` folder structure
- Q&A is being deprecated (Dec 2026) in favor of Copilot — this is the forward-looking approach
- AI instructions are the most impactful feature — Copilot uses them to understand business context, terminology, and calculation rules
- Synonym guidance embedded in AI instructions provides a belt-and-suspenders backup

### Scope

- **50 table synonyms** across 10 tables (all from architecture doc §2.3)
- **66 column synonyms** across 20 high-impact columns
- **53 value synonyms** across 7 columns (tier values, channel values, status values, etc.)
- **CSR priority addressed**: "agents", "service reps", "customer service agents", "support agents", "representatives" all map to `csr` table

### Risk

The `Copilot/linguisticMetadata.json` path is inferred from the Fabric definition spec — if Fabric doesn't consume this file for Q&A synonym resolution, the synonyms won't take effect in the linguistic engine. The AI instructions (which include explicit table name guidance) serve as the fallback and are definitively consumed by Copilot.

### Deployment

- **Operation ID:** `24a78c70-3398-45bf-96b4-18daf94e59d1`
- **Status:** ✅ Success
- **Post-deployment fixes applied:** version.json `$schema` property, settings.json validation
- **169 synonyms deployed** (50 table + 66 column + 53 value) + 53-line AI instructions

### Next Steps

1. Run `python scripts/configure-linguistic-schema.py --dry-run` to verify
2. Run `python scripts/configure-linguistic-schema.py` to deploy
3. Verify in Fabric portal → Prep data for AI → check that synonyms and instructions appear
4. Test with natural language: "show me all agents" should resolve to `csr` table
5. If linguistic metadata file isn't consumed, consider manual entry via Fabric portal UI as fallback

## Monochrome Metro Icon Redesign + Bebas Neue Wordmark Font (2026-04-25)

**Author:** Linus (Frontend Dev)  
**Date:** 2026-04-25  
**Status:** Implemented  

All 6 agent tab icons redesigned to match AAP mobile app's flat, single-color silhouette aesthetic. ADVANCE wordmark switched to Bebas Neue display font.

### Icons — Flat Monochrome Metro Style

| Agent | Icon | Style |
|-------|------|-------|
| crew-chief | Steering wheel (circle + 3 spokes) | Stroke + fill, clean geometry |
| pit-crew | Wrench silhouette | Single filled path |
| gearup | Five-point star | Filled polygon, loyalty/rewards |
| ignition | Megaphone/bullhorn | Filled path, marketing |
| partspro | Document with lines (product catalog) | Filled path, evenodd cutouts |
| diehard | Storefront with awning + door | Filled paths, store operations |

**All icons use ill="#1E1E1E" only.** No gradients, no secondary colors. Strokes also use #1E1E1E.

### Font — "ADVANCE" Wordmark

- Switched .wordmark-primary from Open Sans 700 to **Bebas Neue** (Google Fonts)
- Bebas Neue: condensed, geometric display font — closest match to AAP's custom condensed industrial typeface
- Font-weight: 400 (Bebas Neue single weight only)
- Font-size: 26px desktop (was 22px; Bebas Neue narrower/taller)
- Responsive: 20px tablet, 18px small mobile
- All other text remains Open Sans

### Tab Accent Colors

No changes — tab labels and active borders still use --active-accent CSS variable. Monochrome icons work well alongside colored tab names.

### Files Modified

- web/img/crew-chief.svg — new steering wheel
- web/img/pit-crew.svg — new wrench
- web/img/gearup.svg — new star
- web/img/ignition.svg — new megaphone
- web/img/partspro.svg — new document/catalog
- web/img/diehard.svg — new storefront
- web/index.html — added Bebas Neue to Google Fonts import
- web/css/app.css — updated .wordmark-primary font-family/size, responsive sizes

## Reasoning Sidebar Architecture (2026-01-24)

**Author:** Linus (Frontend Dev)  
**Status:** Implemented  

Add collapsible **Reasoning Sidebar** (right side) to show agent decision-making process in real-time for transparency and debugging visibility. Marketing team users (non-technical) need to see what the agent is doing.

### Design

- Fixed right sidebar (~360px desktop, full-width mobile)
- Toggle button in top-bar-right (info icon)
- Color-coded steps: routing (blue), API calls (amber), responses (green), errors (red)
- Timestamps + duration tracking for each step
- Auto-scroll to bottom as steps arrive
- Fade-in animations for visual polish

### Data Model

```js
{
    type: 'routing' | 'agent-call' | 'agent-response' | 'thinking' | 'error',
    agent: 'pit-crew',
    message: 'Analyzing query keywords...',
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    duration: null  // filled when step completes
}
```

### Architecture

- Global easoningSteps[] array in pp.js
- Exposed window.addReasoningStep() and window.completeLastReasoningStep() for cross-file use
- Cleared on each new message send
- xecutive.js emits routing/synthesis steps
- gent-client.js can emit API call timing (future: SSE step events from backend)

### Rationale

1. **Transparency builds trust** — Marketing users feel confident when they see the agent "working"
2. **Debugging visibility** — Dave can see what's happening when something goes wrong
3. **Extensible** — As backend becomes richer (SQL queries, data stats), we can pipe that through
4. **Non-intrusive** — Closed by default, users opt in when curious
5. **Vanilla JS** — No framework dependencies, keeps bundle small

### Files Changed

- web/index.html — reasoning sidebar HTML
- web/css/app.css — reasoning panel styles
- web/js/app.js — reasoning state + rendering
- web/js/executive.js — Crew Chief routing hooks

## Responsive Design Breakpoints & Approach (2026-07)

**Author:** Linus (Frontend Dev)  
**Status:** Implemented  

Implement responsive layout using CSS-only media queries with four breakpoints for tablet and mobile support.

### Breakpoints

- **Desktop** (≥1024px) — existing layout, no changes
- **Tablet** (768–1023px) — tab descriptions hidden, chat full-width, input full-width
- **Mobile** (<768px) — single-column, sticky input, vertical sample questions, scroll-snap tabs, 44px touch targets
- **Small mobile** (<375px) — further size reductions for narrow screens

### Approach

- **Desktop-first** — existing layout is baseline; layer responsive overrides on top
- **CSS-only** — no JavaScript needed for layout changes; media queries + flexbox handle all reflow
- **100dvh** used alongside 100vh for mobile browser address bar handling (Safari, Chrome mobile)
- **ont-size: 16px** on mobile input prevents iOS auto-zoom behavior
- **nv(safe-area-inset-bottom)** on input bar handles iPhone notch/home indicator

### Impact

- web/css/app.css — sole file modified
- No changes to HTML structure or JavaScript
- Marketing team users on tablets/phones can now use the chat UI comfortably

## Query Handling — Edge Cases (2026-04-25)

**Author:** Basher (Backend Dev)  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Commit:** 93373c5

Added a ## Query Handling — Edge Cases section to all 5 Fabric Data Agent instruction files, standardizing how agents respond when questions can't be fully answered.

### Rationale

The existing guardrails only said "don't fabricate data." In practice, users ask ambiguous questions, partially-answerable questions, and cross-domain questions. Without explicit guidance, agents either silently drop parts of questions or give unhelpful generic refusals.

### Content

Four escalation patterns, applied consistently across all agents:

1. **Ambiguous Questions** — Ask one focused clarifying question before querying
2. **Partial Data Available** — Answer what you can, explicitly explain the gap
3. **Data Not Available** — Be specific about what's missing, suggest alternatives
4. **Out of Scope** — Explain why another agent is better suited before referring

### Team Impact

- **All agents:** Same wording ensures consistent UX regardless of which agent handles the query
- **Linus (Frontend):** No frontend changes needed — this is agent instruction content only
- **Livingston:** No data layer changes — instructions reference existing data capabilities

### Files Modified

- gents/customer-service/customer-service-instructions.md
- gents/loyalty-program-manager/loyalty-program-manager-instructions.md
- gents/marketing-promotions/marketing-promotions-instructions.md
- gents/merchandising/merchandising-instructions.md
- gents/store-operations/store-operations-instructions.md

## Business Capability Overview Document (2026-07)

**Owner:** Danny (Lead/Architect)  
**Status:** Delivered  
**Related:** docs/capability-overview.md

Created docs/capability-overview.md as the primary stakeholder-facing summary of the AAP Data Agent POC capabilities. Target audience is AAP executives, marketing leadership, and technical sponsors—not the implementation team.

### Rationale

AAP stakeholders need a clear, non-technical explanation of:
1. What problem the POC solves (data access bottleneck)
2. What the experience feels like (live demo walkthrough)
3. How the five specialized agents map to business domains
4. What real production deployment looks like (step-by-step, timelines)
5. What comes after the POC (roadmap)

The technical architecture (docs/architecture.md) is excellent for implementation teams but overwhelming for business stakeholders. This document translates capability into business narrative.

## Data Approach Document & Schema Migration Prompts (2026-04)

**Owner:** Danny (Lead/Architect)  
**Status:** Decided & Implemented  
**Related:** docs/data-approach.md

Created docs/data-approach.md as a living reference document serving two purposes:

1. **As-built documentation:** Explains the POC schema we built (10 Delta tables, 2.8M rows, placeholder data), why we built it that way, and how true we stayed to AAP's architecture diagram
2. **Forward-looking playbook:** Provides 7 actionable prompts for migrating from placeholder schema to AAP's real Snowflake schema when it becomes available

## Documentation Consolidation — July 2026

**Owner:** Danny (Lead/Architect)  
**Status:** Completed & Documented

Consolidated docs given that web/docs.html now serves as primary stakeholder-facing documentation.

### Decision

1. **Archive executive-level docs** that are now covered by docs.html
2. **Remove all sample SQL queries** from data-schema.md
3. **Consolidate schema migration docs** into single production-schema-migration.md
4. **Keep technical references** that provide depth

## Inline SVG Injection for All Agent Icons (2025-07)

**Author:** Linus (Frontend Dev)  
**Status:** Implemented

Use a shared injectSvgIcon() helper with an in-memory SVG cache for all agent icon rendering.

### Rationale

- **Consistency:** All icons display in their agent's brand color everywhere
- **Performance:** SVG cache avoids redundant fetches
- **Maintainability:** Single helper function for all icon locations

## Category-Specific Return Rate Multipliers (2026-07)

**Author:** Saul (Data Engineer)  
**Status:** Implemented

Added per-category return rate multipliers to address unrealistic variance in return rates across categories.

### Decision

- Base return rate: 3%
- Category-specific multipliers applied
- Realistic spread: 0.3–3.0x based on product category
- Categories like electronics now show higher return rates than consumables

---

## Category-Weighted Product Selection for Return Transactions (2026-07)

**Author:** Saul (Data Engineer)  
**Status:** Implemented

Use category-weighted product selection for return transactions using andom.choices() with category-specific weights rather than uniform selection.

### Weight Distribution

| Category     | Weight |
|-------------|--------|
| Electrical  | 3.0    |
| Lighting    | 2.5    |
| Accessories | 2.2    |
| Batteries   | 1.8    |
| Brakes      | 1.3    |
| Spark Plugs | 1.1    |
| Wipers      | 0.8    |
| Filters     | 0.5    |
| Engine Oil  | 0.3    |
| Coolant     | 0.3    |

## LLM Diagnostic Report in Sanity Check Notebook (2026-07)

**Author:** Saul (Data Engineer)  
**Status:** Implemented

Add a structured LLM diagnostic report to 
otebooks/02-data-sanity-check.py that maps each FAIL/WARN check result to its root cause and fix pattern in  1-create-sample-data.py.

### Rationale

- The sanity check notebook identifies problems but doesn't tell you HOW to fix them
- The Fabric portal has embedded Copilot that can edit notebooks — but it needs structured instructions
- A DIAGNOSTIC_MAP dictionary provides a maintainable mapping from check names to generator code locations

### Convention Established

Every sanity check added to  2-data-sanity-check.py should have a matching entry in DIAGNOSTIC_MAP with section, lines, root_cause, and fix fields.
